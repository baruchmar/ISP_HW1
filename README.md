# ISP_HW1
First Project about Processes

## Plan
We will update the code here with commits in order to keep track

## Go to GIT commands

Open Command line in directory of the project and type the following codes:

```bash
git status
```
This gives you an update which files have been changed since last commit.

```bash
git add <filename>
If you type: git add .
It adds all files.
```
This adds the file changes to be committed.

```bash
git commit -a -m "Message describing Commit"
```
Make the message have some meaning to it.

```bash 
git push origin main
```

Pushes the changes to the repository so that we can all access the changes.
